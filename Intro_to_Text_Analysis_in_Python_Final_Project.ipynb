        "As a dynamic and rapidly developing region, rapid industrialization and rising living standards have led to increased energy consumption, placing immense pressure on existing energy systems. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has projected a 60% increase in the region's energy demand by 2040 ([International Energy Agency, 2019](https://https://www.iea.org/reports/southeast-asia-energy-outlook-2019)). This is compounded by the exponential growth of data centers and artificial intelligence technologies in Southeast-Asia - with tech firms like Google, Amazon Web Services, Nvidia and Alibaba heavily investing in the region. These energy-intensive initiatives are accelerating the need for sustainable energy solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Nuclear energy has emerged as a potential solution for the region's growing energy demands. In the [2016-2025 ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation](https://asean.org/book/asean-plan-of-action-for-energy-cooperation-apaec-2016-2025-phase-ii-2021-2025/), member countries have committed to build capabilities in policy, technology and regulatory aspects of nuclear energy as part of their broader aspirations to increase the region’s uptake of renewable energy sources [(ASEAN, 2016)](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ASEAN-Plan-of-Action-for-Energy-Cooperation-APAEC-2016-2025-Phase-II-2021-2025.pdf). Although nuclear energy is not yet a major part of the region's energy portfolio, this project will focus on three countries that have expressed interest in further exploration:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Philippines**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Philippines houses the region's first and only nuclear power plant - the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. Although construction was completed in 1984, the plant was never commissioned following public fears in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl accident. However, in 2023, the Philippines signed a Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with the United States to facilitate the transfer of knowledge, nuclear materials and equipment for potential nuclear power projects - otherwise known as the '123 Agreement' [(U.S. Department of State, 2024)](https://www.state.gov/u-s-philippines-civil-nuclear-cooperation-agreement-enters-into-force/). The country aims to to have 1,200 MW of installed nuclear power capacity by 2032.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Indonesia**\n",
        "\n",
        "Internally, Indonesia has included nuclear energy in its plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. As of 2024, Indonesia plans to construct nuclear power plants, mainly small modular reactors (SMRs) with a 1,000 to 2,000 MW capacity in the 2030s.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Singapore**\n",
        "\n",
        "Presently, Singapore is engaging in further research and development to evaluate the use of advanced nuclear energy technologies (especially SMRs). In July 2024, Singapore signed the 123 Agreement with the United States in hopes of engaging in greater [(U.S. Department of State, 2024)](https://www.state.gov/u-s-singapore-civil-nuclear-cooperation-agreement-enters-into-force/).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite renewed government interest, public interest remain generally low. Historical complexities surrounding nuclear power and instances of reactor failures have made nuclear energy a potentially controversial energy source in the region. A 2021 study found that 39% of Indonesians and 22% of Singaporeans were in favour of nuclear energy development. On the contrary, a separate 2019 study found that 65% of Filipinos supported the construction of a new nuclear power plant [(Nuclear Business Platform, 2024)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/news/detail/public-support-for-nuclear-energy-in-southeast-asia-generally-low). As countries make the push towards nuclear energy, it is crucial to develop public knowledge surrounding nuclear energy concurrently - which should fundamentally be designed around the misconceptions and misinformation that individuals may have. This would allow countries to build public trust and confidence in their nuclear programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Research Objectives and Significance\n",
        "This study will examine how mainstream media outlets in Southeast Asia frame the potential adoption of nuclear energy using data science techniques. Focusing on media coverage in three key countries—the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore—the analysis explores whether nuclear energy is portrayed as a risk, a necessity, or a forward-looking solution. By comparing central narratives across these countries, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the region’s collective stance. In doing so, this study seeks to identify the opportunities and barriers for nuclear energy adoption - and insights into the interplay between media narratives and public opinion.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Research Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   What are the main narratives or themes associated with nuclear energy in the mainstream media outlets of each country?\n",
        "2.   Do the narratives vary across the three countries?\n",
        "3. How might the media representation of nuclear energy shape public perceptions, and influence policy decisions?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis\n",
        "Countries such as Indonesia and Philippines that are at advanced planning stages of the energy transition likely framing nuclear more positively. On the contrary, countries such as Singapore that are still exploring the potential of nuclear energy may present a more cautious narrative and emphasize its risks.\n"

Marcos believed then that nuclear power was the solution to meeting the country's energy demand by decreasing dependence on oil importation. However, BNPP never became operational, as it was deactivated by his successor, President Corazon Aquino, due to safety concerns following the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Look at our country's exposure and lack of resilience towards imported inflation and you have the answer. Domestic inflation is inflation caused in the country such as wage increases, locally sourced input prices, productivity improvements or lags and competitiveness resulting from the quality of one's industry, management and workforce.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Imported inflation would affect the cost of commodities such as oil, coal and natural gas and food, given our failure to feed ourselves, as well as the cost of trade given the supply chain issues. Same with finished products, which we mostly import and hardly manufacture ourselves.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The global prices and supply issues for internationally traded inputs and goods cannot be avoided, whether they are exported or imported. For example, copper and nickel concentrates, which we export, follow internationally set spot prices, which also serve as the basis on how longer-term supply contracts are priced.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >However, the margins for processed and smelted copper and nickel have a different and higher price – being value added. More so with end products such as cell phones, electric vehicles and so on; plus the critical finished components that go into them, many of which are copper, nickel and lithium-based. Two general rules: the more processed a product is, the more value is added to it and the higher its price is.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Also, when margins for raw products are high, then margins contract for processed products and the opposite is true as well. However, margins are usually positive for processing, provided the manufacturer meets certain standards, but for raw or near raw products such as copper concentrate, the producer is generally a price taker. If your production cost exceeds the selling price, you will lose money, and if that is sustained, the producer must eventually shut down as what happened to many of our mines in the 1990s.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If you are a low-cost producer, then you have a large margin to deal with, like the major copper mines in Australia, Chile and Peru. We would add value and shield ourselves from many of the swings by being processors and not just producers of raw products. As Indonesia has become that in less than a decade in nickel.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >With that as the backdrop, given the normal vagaries of economic cycles and supply, this is likely to be a volatile decade as there has globally been under investment in processing and manufacturing in the first world because of the 2008 financial crisis. A lot of manufacturing has moved East to China, India and South Korea. The demand for finished products, which are continuously and increasingly added value, continues unabated, and we do not benefit as we are not part of that production chain.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Compare the size, weight and capabilities of a cell phone in the 1990s to any smartphone today and you see my point. It's the same with televisions and nearly everything else. There is less raw product and input, and more intelligence and applications. <span class=\"companylink\">Apple</span> cannot launch a new iPhone without producing it in China. When dealing with vaccines during Covid-19, the roll out was delayed as so much projected production for export was supposed to come from India. Same with complex semiconductors – China, Taiwan and South Korea are critical. Thailand, Vietnam and – to a lesser extent – Malaysia and Indonesia are also part. We import nearly everything and export people.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If we can expect volatility and disruption in many forms and guises, what have we done to ameliorate the effects? Sadly, not much. What mining products we export are as close to being as raw as they can be. Did we take advantage of demand like Indonesia has over the last five years to require more processing by disallowing exports of raw nickel? No. Instead, we even went backwards on raw production during the Aquino and most of the Duterte regimes. I hear there are plans to go up the mining value chain now. As Mr. Sy used to jokingly tell me sometimes when I could not do something in the timeframe he wanted, he would refer to it as \"overdue.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In our agricultural products, we have the embarrassing distinction of being the only populous country — with 100 million plus — incapable of feeding its people and dependent on imports for not just our staples, but vegetables and meat as well. This leads us to be literally the world champion in self-imposed imported food inflation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Our inability to feed ourselves while growing our population from under 20 million to soon over 120 million in 60+ years has dire consequences beyond inflation. It affects food security, nutrition — given the higher cost of food and its availability and the nutritional quality of substitute and lower levels of food intake — which affects the quality of our workforce and increasing population, social stability, and thus the viability of our economy. Think I am exaggerating? We reduced the minimum height for male and female police officers a few years ago. We are getting smaller while our neighbors are growing taller and bigger.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What have other countries done to ameliorate imported inflation in something we are also world leaders in – expensive power. That renders us woefully uncompetitive in manufacturing. Everyone must pay market rates for inputs for power be it coal, natural gas and for peaking plants oil. This is whether they are producers or importers. What have many countries done? Lessen their dependence on these inputs and lower power costs that are already lower than ours.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The forward-looking countries are well on their way on the long transition from an oil and gas economy to a renewable energy economy. That is why we are a manufacturing wasteland compared to all our Southeast Asian neighbors. The cost of production in heavy manufacturing is 40 to 50-percent lower. Why would any sane person engage in that in the Philippines, absent other compensation factors, if power rates are often 20 to 40-percent higher here. How did other countries deal with power costs besides starting with cheaper power to maintain their competitiveness and deal with imported inflation?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For power generation, their active push for renewable power — from the West to China, Japan and South Korea — includes using subsidies that have now more than paid their way with the relentless and amazing drop in the cost of the inputs for renewable energy. In some cases, by over 90 percent (solar panels and wind turbines) in a decade as they continued to shift to renewables. This is due to economies of scale and improved technology.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Yet, here we are arguing about nuclear power, which is the longest to get going and the most expensive in levelized costs when building new capacity and in which the Bataan Nuclear Museum would require. Plus, modular nuclear is still a concept being tested for commercial viability. Amazing that our leading nuclear cheerleaders don't understand levelized cost. Wonder what nonsense their consultants are peddling them.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Countries are also grappling with the change in the transmission system, which will have to adapt for new input areas for accepting power generation sources. Given that we are one of the few developing countries that privatized transmission, we now must revise the blueprint for that, which the law providing for our private sector transmission grid did not envision. No one at the time did, given the renewable push had not yet started. But what are we doing now that there is going to be distributed generation from places unexpected.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For vehicles, over 10 years ago, places such as Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong gave subsidies to encourage hybrid vehicles while the Aquino administration refused, as they felt tax cuts for this would open the floodgates for other cuts. If you went to those countries even 10 years ago, you would see many of the taxis and buses were already hybrid, which generally used at least 50 percent less gasoline or diesel than traditional vehicles. The tax incentives more than paid their way in lower oil imports and vehicle mileage efficiency. I am happy the Marcos administration provided subsidies for electric vehicles.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After reluctantly giving up on the Toyota Prius, which I brought back from the the United States of America in 2010 for lack of parts and service, I bought a BYD electric car two months ago and am very happy with it. I often charge it during the day when the solar panels that I installed in my house 2 years ago provide the most renewable power. It has also cut my home power bill in half.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That is how you deal with imported inflation; not by ignoring it but by lessening your dependence on it by being forward-looking and thinking and acting in an anticipatory and developmental manner rather than reacting to crisis and shortages.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Parson's framework focuses on choices between dichotomies like affectivity versus affective neutrality and universalism versus particularism. Indonesia's collectivist nature aligns with particularism, where decisions are influenced by relationships and context rather than universal rules. This could mean that nuclear power adoption depends heavily on the endorsement of influential groups and individuals.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Another critical variable is time perspective. Indonesia tends to have an asynchronous approach, taking time to build and make decisions unless faced with a life-or-death situation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This cultural trait can slow down the implementation of long-term projects like nuclear reactors unless there is a compelling, immediate need.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Relational orientation emphasizes harmony and relationships, meaning that any major project like a nuclear reactor would need to manage complex social dynamics and gain widespread acceptance to proceed smoothly.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Referring to Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation Theory, Indonesia, with its cautious approach, might be placed in the late majority, particularly for high-stakes technologies like nuclear power.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Therefore, if Indonesia were to adopt a new technology, it should avoid unproven ones. Small modular reactors (SMRs) would be more appropriate for initial use than a thorium reactor.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Indonesia has a history of executing significant strategic projects despite cultural and political challenges. For example, the nickel downstream industry in Morowali, Central Sulawesi, has been successfully developed despite resistance.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >However some strategic projects, despite being technologically and structurally sound, have faced obstacles such as funding, political support and market acceptance. High-tech industries like the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (Lapan), state-owned shipbuilding company PT PAL and state steel maker <span class=\"companylink\">PT Krakatau Steel</span> have encountered these challenges.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >State-owned oil and gas company <span class=\"companylink\">PT Pertamina</span>, telecommunications firm PT Telkom Indonesia, railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia and electricity company PT PLN share the commonality of success that relies on the country's capability to sustain and improve existing infrastructures, rather than focusing solely on disruptive innovation.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Another notable example is Indonesia's COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Facing a life-threatening pandemic, the country achieved one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, rapidly vaccinating a significant portion of its population.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This success was driven by unified political will, the absence of funding disputes and a collective agreement on the urgency of the situation. It demonstrates that when a crisis presents a clear and present danger, Indonesia can mobilize resources and public support effectively.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While nuclear power is not an immediate priority for Indonesia, it may become relevant by 2045. Its current reliance on coal and the pressing issues of food security as a developing nation take precedence over the climate change concerns typically championed by developed countries.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The country's political landscape and cultural attitudes will significantly influence this transition.

Presidential Decree No. 14/2024 emphasizes Indonesia's commitment to bolstering global environmental sustainability by targeting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.</p>\n",
        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >CCS involves capturing CO2 emissions from sources like power plants or industrial facilities, transporting it to storage sites and securely depositing it underground to prevent atmospheric release. However, CCS demands substantial upfront investment in infrastructure and technology, along with significant energy consumption for its operations.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To effectively fight climate change, energy for CCS must originate from clean sources such as renewables, nuclear or fossil-fired power plants equipped with CCS technology. The latter may utilize approximately 20-25 percent of their produced energy to power CCS equipment and double the levelized cost of energy (LCOE).</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The scale of capital and energy required for CCS implementation is immense. According to the <span class=\"companylink\">International Energy Agency</span> (<span class=\"companylink\">IEA</span>), achieving a 1.5-degree Celsius temperature increase limit solely through CCS solutions necessitates an annual investment of US$3.5 trillion until 2050 and an energy output equivalent to 26 peta-hours by 2050, surpassing global energy demand in 2022.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Historically, the first implementation of CCS dates back to the early 1970s, when CO2 captured from a gas processing facility in Texas, the United States was piped to a nearby oil field and injected to enhance oil recovery, known as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Although CCUS isn't primarily intended as a climate solution due to its alignment with the oil and gas industry's interests, it boasts a clear business model.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The first commercial CO2 storage was the Sleipner CCS project in Norway in 1996. The catalyst for CCS in the Sleipner case was the Norwegian carbon tax on petroleum introduced in 1991, which otherwise would have subjected <span class=\"companylink\">Statoil</span> (now <span class=\"companylink\">Equinor</span>) to a hefty 1 million krone ($93,483) per day in CO2 taxes. The natural gas extracted from the Sleipner West field contains up to 9 percent CO2, exceeding the maximum 2.5 percent permitted for export specifications and customer requirements. Until then, CCS had primarily been regarded as an economic rather than a climate change solution.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There have been numerous CCS projects initiated worldwide, yet after more than five decades, a report by the <span class=\"companylink\">Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis</span> (<span class=\"companylink\">IEEFA</span>) suggests that these ventures are more prone to failure than success. Around 73 percent of the CO2 they manage to capture annually is sold to fossil fuel companies and utilized to extract more oil.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Among the 13 large-scale projects studied, seven underperformed, two failed outright, and one was halted. While three projects succeeded, they were all linked to the natural gas processing sector, primarily aimed at mitigating production-related emissions from gas with high CO2 content.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Notably, the Kemper project, once hailed as a flagship for carbon capture technology, has crumbled into ruins after receiving $270 million from the <span class=\"companylink\">US Department of Energy</span>. Additionally, despite receiving ($39.9 million) in funding from the federal government, Gorgon, the world's largest CCS project located in Australia, failed to meet its objectives, falling short by approximately 50 percent in its first five years of operation. More recently, the cancellation of the Genesee CCS project in Alberta, Canada, was attributed to its lack of economic feasibility.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Here lies the dilemma: CCS, being capital-intensive, relies heavily on public funding for projects like Gorgon and Kemper, among others, yet the returns thus far have been insignificant. This prompts a critical question: Should taxpayers' money continue to be invested in a technology with a high likelihood of failure, or should our focus shift toward proven alternatives?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While CCS holds promise for mitigating emissions, its track record raises doubts about its viability as a long-term solution. Perhaps it's time to redirect resources toward established technologies and alternatives that have demonstrated effectiveness in combating climate change, ensuring a more prudent and impactful use of public funds.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One argument in favor of CCS is its potential application in industries that are notoriously difficult to decarbonize, such as cement production, where the inherent chemistry contributes to up to 60 percent of carbon emissions, notably through the production of clinker. Demonstrating this potential, the Heidelberg Materials Breivik cement plant in Norway stands as possibly the world's first CO2-capture facility in the cement sector.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >However, the effectiveness of this technology is contingent upon the energy source used in production. In Norway, where 98 percent of electricity is hydroelectric, CCS integration aligns well with renewable energy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Conversely, in Indonesia, where 85 percent of energy stems from fossil fuel combustion, CCS implementation may not yield significant emission reductions. Additionally, transitioning to cleaner cement, incorporating CO2 capture and sequestration, comes at a substantial cost premium, ranging from 75 percent to 140 percent higher than conventional cement.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Consequently, the pivotal question emerges: Could carbon credits, with an additional cost of up to 100 percent per tonne of cement, incentivize corporations to adopt cleaner cement solutions as part of their offsetting strategies?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Developing both cleaner energy sources and CCS simultaneously presents a considerable challenge in countries with limited capital and a predominant reliance on fossil-fired power plants. CCS may only be viable in countries where the carbon tax exceeds the cost of CO2 injection and where electrical grids are primarily powered by renewable or nuclear sources. Therefore, prioritizing the development of cleaner energy sources over CCS becomes imperative.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Indonesia, boasting an estimated potential of 29 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal energy resources, the largest globally, has only tapped into less than 15 percent of this potential. Hence, directing efforts toward the development of geothermal energy emerges as a wiser choice than CCS. Moreover, to expedite the energy transition, integrating nuclear energy becomes essential, as highlighted by US special envoy for climate change, John Kerry, at the United Nations climate change conference (COP28) in Dubai last year.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Recent advancements in small modular reactor (SMR) technology offer a promising solution. SMRs can effectively power small islands and remote regions where geothermal or hydropower resources are unavailable. Furthermore, SMRs offer a distinct advantage over solar or wind power plants by providing baseload power, ensuring a stable and reliable electricity supply regardless of external factors.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Government funding or support, in the form of tax credits or direct subsidies, should therefore not be allocated to support CCS initiatives. Rather, efforts shall be concentrated on advancing the development of renewable energy and possibly SMR technology. If financial gain might be a primary concern, carbon storage (CS) could potentially offer a viable option for Indonesia.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Highly industrialized nations with limited land resources, such as Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, might find themselves in a predicament where they need to dispose of their carbon emissions. In such a scenario, Indonesia could serve as a recipient of this surplus carbon, acting as a repository for their toxic waste.</p>\n",

Chairman of House Commission VII overseeing energy, Sugeng Suparwoto from the NasDem Party, spoke to The Jakarta Post's A. Muh.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Answer: My role as Commission VII chairman is to drive everyone so we can soon transition to renewable energies. Why? Because fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal have a lot of problems. Economically speaking, their supplies are limited and [environmentally speaking] they are pollutants.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Per day, we produce only 620,000 barrels through oil lifting. Meanwhile, we consume at least 1.4 million barrels of oil daily. To close this gap we import up to 800,000 barrels of oil daily. You can imagine how precarious this situation is.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In terms of gas, we are lucky to have a proven upstream reserve of at least 60 trillion cubic feet. Currently we consume 60 percent of our production and export 40 percent of it. That is good, but while we mainly export LNG [liquefied natural gas], at the same time we import LPG [liquefied petroleum gas].</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >We have an abundance of coal, another fossil fuel. But we also know that coal is the primary source of carbon emissions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >So, we, at the Commission VII, are pushing the [passing of the] renewable energy bill, which is expected to enable an ecosystem for the development of renewable energy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >We hope that the [deliberation of the] bill can be finished within two sitting periods--the current session and the one that will start on Oct. 15.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If we can do so, we will have a renewable energy law during our <span class=\"companylink\">Group of 20</span> presidency, which has listed energy transition as one of [its priority] themes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The government has set a target to have at least 23 percent of renewables in its energy mix by 2025 and 31 percent by 2050. What is the House doing to support the government to achieve these targets on time or even sooner?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The target of having 23 percent of renewable energy by 2025 seems to be a hard target to reach today because currently only about 12 percent of electricity comes from renewables.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Coal is our only energy source that we can control. But we also cannot escape the fact that coal is the highest contributor of carbon emissions.</p>\n",

Wall Street company <span class=\"companylink\">Lazard</span> estimates that the cost of building a large nuclear plant ranges from $7,800 to $12,800 per kW, and that the cost of each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity is between 13 and 20 US cents.

Consider the example of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) Experiment, which operated intermittently from 1965 to 1969 in <span class=\"companylink\">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</span> in Tennessee. Over those four years, the reactor's operations were interrupted 225 times. Of these, only 58 were planned. The remaining were due to various unanticipated technical problems.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Should an MSR be built, it will also saddle society with the challenge of dealing with the radioactive wastes it will produce. This is especially difficult because the waste from MSRs is in chemical forms that are \"not known to occur in nature\" and it is unclear \"which, if any, disposal environment could accommodate this high-level waste\" (L. Krall, A. Macfarlane, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Aug. 31, 2018).</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >ThorCon uses uranium that is enriched up to 19.7 percent in the uranium-235 component.

In 2019, we issued Gubernatorial Instruction no. 66/2019, which aimed to strengthen provincial action in reducing air pollution from stationary and non-stationary sources.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Looking ahead, we are building on this foundation in three ways.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >First, the Jakarta administration uses a science-driven policy-making process in developing its policy.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Second, environmental issues, such as air pollution, need to be handled effectively through cross-sectoral collaboration and an innovative instrument that brings all government units to manage the issue based on its functions.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >We must also pay close attention to addressing the root causes of pollution. It is not enough to ban emissions at the end of the tailpipe or on top of the smokestack -- we must identify the economic, social and other pressures that affect emissions, and change these. And we must be careful that our efforts to reduce emissions do not inadvertently create new hardships for the vulnerable among us. The Clean Air Catalyst team is helping to identify these new possibilities for effective, sustained pollution reduction.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Third, all of the aforementioned efforts will not work optimally if only done by one party.

The Texas grid failure is a stark reminder of how extreme weather events are becoming more destructive, testing power infrastructure resilience to their limits and highlights the way that outdated power system management conventions are no longer a fit for our interconnected lives.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When the power outages cascaded through the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid, power prices surged and water systems were left vulnerable to freezing temperatures, robbing some citizens of water and affordable power.</p>\n",

Late last year, Super Typhoon Rolly in the Philippines left hundreds of thousands of people without power, damaging infrastructure and lifeline crops with costs estimated at US$367 million or higher. While no stranger to typhoons, Southeast Asia's island nations are all grappling with the reality that the storms are becoming more intense and unpredictable. It comes as no surprise that the Philippines national meteorological agency has declared that the stronger typhoons were likely attributed to the warming of the sea surface and the atmosphere.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Closer to home, Indonesia started the new year with multiple severe floods on the islands of Kalimantan and Java. The intense floods caused a disruption to state electricity company PLN's coal supply chain, which left around 12 GW of PLN's coal fleet with less than 10 days of supply. It is tempting to claim that all these occurrences are \"unexpected weather events\" or \"uncommon heavy rain\".</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >However, the trend shows that extreme weather is here to stay, and policymakers should heed the warning signs and adopt new planning disciplines to ensure that Indonesia is better prepared to make cost-effective investments before these high-risk events threaten long-term growth goals.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Three key insights from the Texas energy crisis can be useful for Indonesian planners. First, diversified energy sources matter. The Texas power grid is based on centralized thermal power generation, which in winter relies on gas, coal and nuclear for 80 percent of its power. While installation of new wind capacity has picked up in recent years due to seasonality, wind has historically contributed less to the Texas power mix during winter.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In Indonesia, centralized thermal power generation is even more concentrated, with coal power dominating more than half of Indonesia's electricity mix. A sudden interruption to the coal supply chain could leave the key grids at risk of failure.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In fact, this just happened last month. A number of PLN coal power plants in Java reported coal reserve shortages, triggering a warning to the public from a ministry official about a possible rotating blackout. What caused this risk to PLN's most important grid?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Unusual severe flooding in key coal-producing provinces, such as South and East Kalimantan, was cited by the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry as the cause of the coal supply chain problems. Flooding in those provinces put the system at risk because more than 80 percent of Java's coal fleet is supplied by coal from three key provinces: South Sumatra, as well as South and East Kalimantan. This supply risk translated into a situation where PLN's normal coal reserves fell from two weeks of supply to just six days at some plants.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Over-reliance on a single commodity fuel such as coal in Indonesia or gas in Texas increases fuel supply risk for the overall power system. One obvious solution to this problem would be to increase the share of distributed-power generation from multiple energy sources. Increased system diversity is recognized by global power analysts as one of the ways to increase grid resiliency in the face of risks to system stability.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Second, even reliable baseload power can fail under the strain of extreme weather. With gas pipelines frozen and wind turbines slowed by ice, multiple system failures in Texas were largely attributed to the insufficient preparedness of the utility and grid operator in handling extreme weather risks in their system.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Extreme weather risks due to well-documented climate change trends need to be taken seriously by all energy players. Indonesian policymakers should take steps now to anticipate similar adverse-weather risks that can disrupt Indonesia's energy and power infrastructure. Weather-related risks from storms, floods and fires need to be studied in the context of disruption to critical land and marine transportation routes, transmission and distribution network outages. These interconnected risks need to be studied more rigorously as part of any energy system operational risk assessment to identify new energy system vulnerabilities.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Third, grid investment and interconnection must be a higher priority. The standout risk of the Texas power system is due to its isolation from neighboring regional grids. Unlike other regions where investment in interconnection and power trading are well established, Texas has limited options to stabilize its system through interconnection.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As an island nation with a wide geographical spread, Indonesia has often studied the benefits of interconnection between key grids without taking further action. The benefits from targeted investment in interconnection are now rising, notably considering the current excess capacity in the Java grids, while potential demand exists in other grid systems.</p>\n",

This number seems small at a glance, but 47 million people is not just a number, but a harsh reminder.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For most ASEAN countries, the definition is a lot simpler. Most of them define the electrification ratio as the ratio between the number of households on the electricity grid and the total number of homes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Based on the ASEAN Centre for Energy's (ACE) electrification ratio data in 2015, only two countries have reached a 100 percent electrification ratio (universal access): Singapore and Brunei Darussalam. Some countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Indonesia and the Philippines have reached an electrification ratio of above 85 percent (near universal access). Two other countries, Cambodia and Myanmar, still have an electrification ratio below 85 percent. From these data, we can infer that there are three groups of countries base on the electrification ratio.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There are two identified challenges in the abovementioned groups of countries in terms of increasing the electrification ratio, namely geographical factors and affordability.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The first challenge is difficult geography to extend access, especially for rural and remote electrification efforts. Dense tropical rainforests and the remoteness of islands where rural communities live are natural inhibitors to infrastructure development. In such areas it is difficult to install utility poles and high voltage cables that are necessary to connect rural areas to the national grid.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The second challenge is affordability, which usually becomes an issue for the last mile of an electrification effort. For a country that already has an electrification rate above 90 percent, reaching universal access is indeed a great challenge. Sometimes this last-mile electrification is the most expensive and most prolonged compared to the effort of reaching near-universal access. This conclusion is based on what was occurring in China and Mexico.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To help overcome some of these challenges in increasing the electrification ratio, renewable energy could come in handy. For the fifth year in a row, net additions of renewable power generation capacity globally clearly outpaced net installations of fossil fuel and nuclear power capacity combined.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Based on <span class=\"companylink\">UN ESCAP</span> data and the ASEAN Energy Database System (AEDS) per 2016, the majority of renewable energy electricity output in ASEAN comes from hydropower, which produces about 130 terawatt-hours (equivalent to 72 percent of the total ASEAN renewable mix). Other renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, waste, biomass and geothermal are also contributing to the mix.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The avenue to further increase the renewable energy mix is still very much an open door because the ASEAN region's untapped renewable energy potential is still vast. For example, <span class=\"companylink\">World Bank</span> data show that the geothermal power generation potential in Indonesia and the Philippines combined is between 70 to 80 gigawatts (GW), but only 15 percent of known geothermal reserves are exploited for electricity production, generating roughly just 13 GW.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Incorporating renewable energy as a means of increasing the electrification ratio obviously will increase the renewable energy mix in ASEAN so that it could help to achieve the 23 percent mark in 2025. However, another important thing to add is the use of renewable energy could overcome the challenges in the electrification effort.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The first advantage of using renewable energy is its flexibility to be used as an on-grid and off-grid electrification solution. This is proven by the various scales of electrification projects ranging from Vietnam's Dau Tieng Solar Power Complex, which produces 600 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, to microgrid projects by <span class=\"companylink\">Akuo Energy</span> in Indonesia's East Kalimantan villages, which produce 1.2 MWh of electricity.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This advantage could tackle both geographical factors and affordability because the use of renewable energy could be an off-grid solution that does not rely on a centralized grid and could be scaled according to the local demand in order to make it affordable. The use of renewable energy could also maximize the potential of local resources.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The second advantage is the resiliency of renewable energy. Renewable energy systems are sensitive to the negative effects of volatile prices of fuels because they have local independence in energy. Renewable energy is locally produced, managed and maintained, so it does not rely on imports once the project is operational. This resilience is proven by increased demand for renewable energy generation in the COVID-19 lockdown period by 3 percent compared to the start of 2019, while demand for fossil fuel electricity decreased.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The effort to increase the electrification ratio by incorporating renewable energy will be different for each country because of various reasons ranging from geographical factors to local resources, therefore there is no single solution for this effort.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To make sure the efforts do not fail there are several general actions that each country needs to take. First, they should identify their biggest challenges in terms of reaching the aspired electrification ratio.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After identifying these challenges, the next thing they need to do is to identify the solutions that could be applied by incorporating renewable energy into the strategy. This will then create a beneficial solution to the challenges of increasing the electrification ratio because the advantages of renewable energy mentioned above such as flexibility and resiliency would be directly utilized.</p>\n",

This heat is converted into electricity. These reactors typically require large buffer zones, which would be beyond Singapore's radius.Three global nuclear accidents, including the Chernobyl meltdown and the Fukushima disaster, have made these plants controversial.But those incidents involved Generation II reactors, built till the 1990s. Since 2012, advanced Generation III reactors have emerged, promising better performance and safety elements.Traditional nuclear power plants produce massive amounts of energy - 24 million kilowatt-hours each day. One reactor can power 100 million light-emitting diode or LED bulbs. The SMRs are advanced reactors with a lower power capacity that can be factory-assembled and scaled up like Lego bricks. The power capacity of one SMR is about a third of traditional reactors, at about 300MW. With their smaller footprint, SMRs can be set up in dense places not suitable for larger nuclear power plants. SMRs also harness fission energy, but they don't require human intervention to shut down because they rely on natural forces such as circulation, convection and gravity. These increased safety elements significantly lower the risk of unsafe radioactive leaks. Most SMRs worldwide are still being developed. The Sun, like all stars, is powered by nuclear fusion.Fusion occurs when two hydrogen isotopes collide, releasing massive amounts of energy - four times more than fission - with 1kg of fuel. To reproduce the Sun's power on Earth, a temperature of over 100 million deg C is needed, with the help of strong magnetic fields in a doughnut-shaped chamber. Fusion reactors are not expected to produce long-lived nuclear waste. And as the fusion process is difficult to start and maintain, there is no risk of a runaway reaction and meltdown. While experimental reactors are being built, there is a long way to go before a commercial plant is up. Experts said the earliest we could expect to see one could be in the 2040s.Source: <span class=\"companylink\">IAEA</span>, <span class=\"companylink\">US Department of Energy</span>, <span class=\"companylink\">European Commission</span>\n",

The menacing face, as mentioned earlier, will lead to the production of even more deadly weapons and unimaginable harm.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >No wonder, then, many want the nations of the world to agree to a treaty on the non-proliferation of AI, similar to that which exists for nuclear weapons -- the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) -- and for a body like the <span class=\"companylink\">IAEA</span> to conduct inspections and watch for violations.</p>\n",

This will not be easy because of a number of obstacles. First, unlike nuclear weapons, the development and distribution of AI technology is often in the hands of private companies, not countries. A treaty will have limited impact on them. The difficulties that governments have encountered in regulating Big Tech companies in the social media industry reflect what challenges they will face in trying to regulate AI.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Also, unlike nuclear weapons, which require huge facilities like reactors and enrichment plants, AI technology can be developed in an ordinary office space and is hard to detect.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Finally, while the testing of nuclear weapons is highly conspicuous, AI technology can be tested more discreetly, such as by launching huge campaigns of hate speech and images to be distributed anonymously around the world.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >With all these challenges, it will be daunting for an international governing body to detect or inspect for malicious use of AI.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Since AI software tools that generate dangerous content or trigger dangerous outcomes can be easily multiplied and distributed, they can easily be adopted by parties in the many conflicts around the world, and these include rogue states and terrorist groups.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What can be done?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A key factor that can help stave off an AI arms race will be cooperation between the two major global powers who are also leaders in the field -- the US and China.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The major powers need to recognise their interdependence and the value of collaboration in AI, which should include joint research and development and creating international norms and standards for safety.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The major militaries need to recognise the importance of building safeguards and human controls into their AI systems, to avoid miscalculations that can lead to serious conflict.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Global pressure on the major powers to take the proper steps is needed, through diplomacy, trade, and even moral persuasion. It is imperative for international bodies to bring countries together and convene discussions that build on cooperation that benefits all.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Major tech companies need to ensure that the AI tools they develop and distribute have adequate safeguards and testing to prevent misuse, abuse and accidental harms.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"When I was a student here in the early 90s, there were already fears that Japan would overtake the US. But look what has happened since then. The US economy has remained remarkably strong and resilient,\" he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"If, as a student in 1990, I had put US$100 in the S&P 500, I would be earning a lot of money today.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"For the foreseeable future, at least, I think the US will continue to have a very strong leading position. And that is why we value and appreciate the very close relationship that we have with the US across many different areas.\"</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During his discussions in Washington, Mr Wong reiterated Singapore's commitment to green energy and net zero emissions by 2050 despite being an alternative-energy disadvantaged nation. Singapore is exploring all options to decarbonise its power sector, including emerging technologies like low-carbon hydrogen, and advanced geothermal energy systems.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"In this context, DPM Wong expressed Singapore's interest to cooperate with the US to explore the possible role of civilian nuclear energy in the green energy transition,\" the MFA statement said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In his remarks to the media, Mr Wong said Singapore did not have any easy way to get to net zero because it did not have the means to deploy renewable energy at scale.</p>\n",

In fact, the hottest 12 years have been those since 2010. During that time, climate disasters have repeatedly hit the headlines: epic floods that submerged one-third of Pakistan, Hurricane Ian in the United States that caused damage estimated at US$100 billion (S$137 billion), wildfires in Canada that razed an area as large as Germany, countless tropical storms, and heatwaves in the unlikeliest of places, including the Arctic and Antarctica, to cite but a partial list of recent cases.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >So frequent are the reports highlighting such catastrophes that people have become numbed to news of them. What were once-in-a century, off-the-chart events are being accepted as the new normal hazards of life.</p>\n",
        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As the economist and climate change expert Vinod Thomas, a former senior vice-president of the <span class=\"companylink\">World Bank</span> and currently a senior fellow at the <span class=\"companylink\">ISEAS</span> -- Yusof Ishak Institute, notes in his eye-opening recent book Risk And Resilience In The Era Of Climate Change, it is not enough to simply label these catastrophes as \"climate disasters\" as if they are acts of God. They need to be understood as human-induced, and avertable. The longer they remain unaddressed or under-addressed, the deadlier they will get.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Tipping points will occur from which, Dr Thomas warns, there may be no return, like an irreversible rise in sea levels, the death of coral reefs, devastating marine ecosystems and the extinction of more animal species.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Falling short of what is needed</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The science is clear about what the world needs to do: to reduce carbon emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 if we are to achieve the target of an increase of 1.5 deg C in temperatures compared with pre-industrial levels, according to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But even if all countries abide by their Paris commitments, which is doubtful, emissions will fall by only 7 per cent, according to climate researchers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What is needed, then, is a massive increase in ambition on mitigating climate change by reducing its main source, namely greenhouse gases. Adaptation -- building defences against the impact of climate change -- is of course also needed as part of building resilience, especially in countries most exposed to climate disasters such as island states, river deltas and places most prone to heat waves.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as Dr Thomas points out, adaptation is not enough. \"You don't just need a bigger bucket to collect the water from a leaking roof,\" he says. \"You also need to fix the roof.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >People readily accept measures to boost adaptation, like building sea walls, constructing more heat- and flood-resistant housing and creating early warning systems to alert against climate catastrophes, because these yield immediate benefits.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But when it comes to mitigation, the gains from which accumulate slowly over time, neither people nor politicians appear ready for bold action.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If you ask people, most will agree that climate change is a huge problem, maybe even the biggest facing the world. But do they feel personally at risk? The answer, according to surveys, is mostly no.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And are they willing to bear higher costs associated with mitigation, in the form of, say, higher taxes on fuel or airline tickets? Definitely not.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This ambivalence translates into policies. While politicians solemnly proclaim the need for more ambitious mitigation measures, they don't act like they believe it; the electoral calendar is more important.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Last week, my colleague Jonathan Eyal documented the recent rollbacks on green policies in Europe in what is now being called a \"greenlash\": the rush to authorise new offshore oil drilling platforms in the North Sea by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak who faces an election in 2024; the shelving of plans to ban new oil and gas heating systems for homes in Germany by the end of 2023 by the country's Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck, who comes from the Green Party; and the opposition to nitrogen emission laws by farmers in the Netherlands, whose new anti-green party has made huge gains in recent parliamentary elections.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Climate deniers such as former US president Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban still get high poll numbers. In Asia -- the world's largest emitter of carbon by region -- no country has implemented a carbon tax besides Japan and Singapore.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Politics also intervene when it comes to supporting developing countries' energy transition or even raising funds for climate finance domestically. Rich countries have struggled to mobilise the US$100 billion per year by 2020 for developing countries, which they had pledged during the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >They have even fallen short of raising US$10 billion for the United Nations' main fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change -- a fraction of the US$200 billion to US$250 billion these countries will need every year by 2030, according to a report by the <span class=\"companylink\">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Yet, advanced economies spent at least US$10 trillion in bailouts, stimulus packages and other measures to fight the global financial crisis of 2008 and lavished US$22 trillion to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Misplaced priorities</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This ordering of priorities raises fundamental questions, according to Dr Thomas: \"Is the priority given to a problem related to perceptions of the imminence of outcomes? Are risks that are mostly outside one's control, such as pandemics, valued more than ones that can be influenced by one's own actions? Is attention more easily directed to more immediate and modest issues that are manageable, while postponing the focus on the slower onset of intractable ones, even if they have ultimately deadlier consequences?\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The answer to these questions appears to be yes. What this amounts to, in the context of dealing with climate change, is kicking the can down the road.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But as Professor Nicholas Stern, chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the <span class=\"companylink\">London School of Economics</span> points out, \"this is the opposite of good economics, because it will make the pathway to net-zero more expensive, not less\".</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While the costs of action -- mainly in the form of mitigation -- are high at around 0.6 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) per year (or about US$5.7 trillion relative to 2022 GDP) according to the IPCC, the costs of inaction would be at least four times higher by 2030 and seven times higher by 2050 under a high emissions scenario.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The wrong energy mix</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What kind of energy mix countries choose is also influenced by politics. Granted, this is a tricky issue. While renewables such as solar and wind hold out great promise, with the costs of generation from these sources having plummeted in recent years, they still account for barely 5 per cent of global energy use. More than 75 per cent still comes from hydrocarbons such as coal, oil and gas. Abruptly halting investments in all of these would send energy prices through the roof and be a recipe for disaster.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But that should not be an excuse to persist with politically expedient fuel subsidies, which encourage the consumption of dirty fuels and make it harder for renewable energy sources to compete. According to the <span class=\"companylink\">International Monetary Fund</span>, these hit a record US$7 trillion in 2022, mostly from advanced economies.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In addition, although countries have invested heavily in renewables, this has been more than matched by their investments in dirty energy. For example, India has increased its solar capacity roughly tenfold over the past decade, but also increased its energy generation from coal to the extent that its reliance on hydrocarbons has not been reduced. And in response to the sharp increase in fuel prices in the wake of the war in Ukraine, Germany chose to revive its coal-fired power plants that it had planned to phase out, while instead phasing out its nuclear power plants, which provided clean energy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The political resistance to nuclear energy persists in several countries, even though it is the safest and cleanest energy source. Although there have been a few high-profile nuclear accidents -- in Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 -- that have probably cost thousands of lives, the number of lives lost to respiratory and other illnesses due to the pollution from coal and oil runs into the millions, not to mention the other environmental damage resulting from these energy sources.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The perils of GDP worship</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Finally, the economics profession has failed both politicians and the public by continuing to focus on GDP as the main measure of economic progress, ignoring the depletion of natural capital and the degradation of the environment associated with increases in GDP. For example, destroying a forest to build shopping malls and condominiums adds to GDP, but no adjustment is made for deforestation because there is no market price for the forest and its environmental benefits -- including carbon capture.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Economists agree such adjustments should be made, yet they -- including the <span class=\"companylink\">International Monetary Fund</span> and the <span class=\"companylink\">World Bank</span> -- continue to put GDP growth front and centre in their reports.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What gets measured gets acted on, so politicians continue to enact policies to boost GDP growth per se, regardless of their impact on the environment or human well-being.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There is a narrative propagated by vested interests that green policies are \"anti-growth\". This is false: Investments in renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture and green technologies and industries can lead to massive job creation, as well as GDP growth that is consistent with protecting the environment and reducing the costs of climate change.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As the world gears up for the 28th Conference of the Parties on Climate Change in Dubai at the end of November, the delegates will be confronted with a huge agenda, including raising the ambition for mitigation, delivering on old promises to help countries with adaptation and energy transition and compensating countries for loss and damage associated with climate change. But they also face the challenge of overcoming what is probably the biggest obstacle to positive action in all of these areas: politics.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While this is much cleaner than coal or oil, natural gas is still a fossil fuel - which means that burning it to generate electricity releases heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Last month, Singapore's weatherman announced that temperature records here were broken again last year - it tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And as temperatures climb and more people turn on their air-conditioners, it worsens the urban heat island effect, said Mr Liow Chean Siang, head of environmental certifications at the <span class=\"companylink\">Singapore Environment Council</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The urban heat island effect refers to a phenomenon where buildings, roads and vehicles release heat into the environment, especially at night.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Studies have shown that this has caused temperature differences of up to 7 deg C between urban and less built-up areas of Singapore.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"As more and more households, buildings and offices utilise air-conditioning, expelled heat accumulates outdoors along with the heat from the sun, contributing to the urban heat island effect,\" said Mr Liow.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Air-cons essentially function as heat pumps - while the area surrounding the air-conditioning unit is cooled, the heat is simply transferred outside and expelled to the surroundings, he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr Liow added that higher outdoor ambient temperature would cause people to retreat indoors and potentially increase demand for cooling, creating a vicious circle.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Just as Singapore overcame challenges such as water scarcity by leveraging science, technology and creativity, it is looking to do the same to keep its cool - sustainably - in a warming world.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It may be a hard sell to get people to turn off their air-cons amid the sweltering heat, which is projected by climate scientists to worsen as the climate changes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >So Singapore is tackling this problem on multiple fronts.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >First, it is dealing with the root of the problem - global warming - by ramping up efforts to turn away from fossil fuel-generated energy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Singapore wants to ramp up its solar capacity by more than seven times from current levels by 2030, and increase the current 260 megawatt-peak of installed solar capacity to 2 gigawatt-peak.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At 2 gigawatt-peak, the 2030 solar capacity target will meet about 4 per cent of Singapore's total electricity demand today. Currently, solar energy contributes less than 1 per cent to Singapore's total energy mix.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Solar energy is the most viable form of renewable energy in Singapore, but the highly urbanised, built-up environment here means there are limits to how much sunshine the country can harness.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For example, buildings may cast shade on solar panels deployed on neighbouring rooftops.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To supplement its solar programme, Singapore is also harnessing technology and creativity to drive down the need to turn on the air-con in the first place.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This is done through building green walls and roofs on buildings, and through design.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For example, the buildings in the upcoming Tengah new town will be constructed in a way that maximises thermal comfort.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Researchers created a three-dimensional simulation model that can map buildings in the estate virtually and forecast how environmental factors could affect heat comfort for residents.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This will help planners design open spaces and optimise building layouts and orientation to promote natural ventilation within the town.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On a broader scale, a nationwide research initiative called Cooling Singapore is looking into ways to reduce the urban heat island effect.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Since it was announced in 2017, researchers from institutions such as the Singapore-ETH Centre and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research have come up with a \"menu\" of 86 possible measures across seven key areas to help make Singapore's outdoor environment cooler.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The seven areas are greenery, urban geometry, water features, material and surfaces, shading, transport and energy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For example, varying building heights could improve wind flow, while using light-coloured or reflective surfaces on pavements and building facades could lower absorption of heat from the sun.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Associate Professor Chow, who is also a principal investigator involved in the project, said some infrastructural tweaks can be implemented on a small scale - such as the installation of rooftop gardens and shade structures.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Other changes, such as those requiring regional-level urban planning, may be tougher.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Prof Chow said it may not be easy to totally eradicate the vicious circle, \"but its size can be reduced - through better urban design, more efficient technology, or even changes in consumer behaviour\".</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As solutions to reduce the need for air-conditioning are being studied and fine-tuned, a stop-gap measure is needed to help people keep cool in a more eco-friendly way.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Homes, too, can benefit from energy-efficient air-conditioners.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The <span class=\"companylink\">NEA</span> administers a tick rating system that awards more ticks to energy-efficient air-conditioners, with five ticks denoting the most energy-efficient systems.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >An NEA spokesman said four-tick and five-tick air-con models make up about a third of the 431 models currently registered. While the more energy-efficient models may be more expensive, cost savings can be reaped, she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"A five-tick multi-split air-conditioner operated for eight hours daily will consume about 1,100kwh per year less than a two-tick model.

It analyses the climate pledges of 39 countries and the European Union, covering the biggest emitters as well as a representative sample of smaller emitters, which together contribute about 80 per cent of global emissions. The Republic contributes about 0.11 per cent to global emissions. WHAT THE REPORT SAID ABOUT SINGAPORE Last Wednesday (Sept 15), Climate Action Tracker published its analysis for Singapore's climate targets, ranking them as being \\\"critically insufficient\\\". This is the worst rating on its five-point scale. The other four are: highly insufficient, insufficient, almost sufficient and 1.5 deg C Paris Agreement compatible. Only one country - The Gambia - has targets deemed suitable for the highest category. Nations whose targets were labelled \\\"almost sufficient\\\" include Britain, Nepal, Costa Rica and Ethiopia. Jurisdictions with \\\"insufficient\\\" pledges include the European Union, the United States, Germany and Japan, while countries with \\\"highly insufficient\\\" pledges include Indonesia, China, Australia and India. Under the Paris Agreement, nations must take progressive action to reduce their carbon footprint so the world has a greater chance of limiting warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels - the threshold that warming must be kept to to avoid harsher climate impacts. On this front, Singapore in its updated climate pledge last year said the country's emissions will peak at 65 million tonnes by 2030. This means that even if the economy continues to grow, the amount of emissions produced should not. Over a longer time horizon, Singapore wants to halve the amount of emissions it produces from its 2030 peak by 2050, with the aim of achieving net-zero emissions \\\"as soon as viable in the second half of the century\\\". But the Climate Action Tracker said Singapore's rating showed that the nation's climate policies and commitments \\\"reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement\\\". \\\"If fully implemented, Singapore's current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its targets, but still only in line with 3 deg C warming,\\\" the analysis added. \\\"Singapore needs to set a more ambitious target for emissions reductions and establish associated policies to improve its Climate Action Tracker ratings.\\\"  SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT RESPONDS In response to this assessment, a spokesman for the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) told The Straits Times that the Government is still reviewing the methodology . But he added: \\\"Our preliminary sense is that the Climate Action Tracker may not have fully accounted for our unique challenges as a small city-state with limited access to alternative energy sources.\\\" The spokesman said Singapore's population density is more than 10 times higher than the next densest country in the Climate Action Tracker list, South Korea. He added: \\\"Given our lack of land, Singapore is unable to pursue the same types of solutions as the other countries on the list, for example hydro or nuclear power.\\\" But Singapore is still working to manage its emissions within these constraints through careful long-term planning and innovations in policy and technology, he said. Singapore's energy mix has a low proportion of coal at 1.2 per cent, compared with other countries, including Japan's 29.8 per cent and Germany's 29.2 per cent, said the NCCS spokesman citing Bloomberg data. Coal is the dirtiest form of fossil fuel. Singapore relies largely on natural gas , a fossil fuel cleaner than coal, for its energy needs. More than 95 per cent of its energy comes from this source. The NCCS spokesman also said Singapore is exploring ways to diversify its energy mix by harnessing greener options such as solar energy, clean energy imports, and low-carbon alternatives. The Government is also reviewing the trajectory and level of the carbon tax, post-2023, in consultation with industry and expert groups. He added: \\\" Even as we implement existing initiatives, we also look to enhancing our sustainability goals and actions. Singapore is committed to doing our part to contribute to the global fight against climate change, through tangible action.\\\" Climate policy observer Melissa Low from the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute, acknowledged the country faces constraints in decarbonisation. She said Singapore's updated climate target is closely linked to its first one, and represents progression from an emissions intensity to an absolute peak target. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are urged to make new or updated pledges every five years, so that national climate action is periodically ratcheted up. But as these pledges are determined by nations, it also means that countries are not obligated to submit entirely new ones. They could, for instance, simply resubmit what they had pledged to do in their first one. Under the first pledge made in 2015 , Singapore's main goal was to become greener economically and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted to achieve each dollar of gross domestic product by 36 per cent from 2005 levels, come 2030. It also pledged to stop any further increases to its greenhouse gas emissions by the same timeline. In its updated climate pledge last year, Singapore committed to the absolute peak emission level of 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. Ms Low said the Government had publicly said that Singapore, in the formulation of its 2030 target of reducing emissions per dollar of GDP, had already expected emissions to stabilise at around 65 million tonnes of emissions by then if the former was achieved. \\\"The aim to peak emissions highlights that Singapore will work towards reducing emissions after 2030,\\\" she said. \\\"The enhanced target allows for better accountability but is not necessarily more ambitious.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author_Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fatih Birol\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"CombinedText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 75,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SINGAPORE - A climate research consortium has pegged Singapore's climate targets as being \\\"critically insufficient\\\" - the worst rating on a five-point scale - putting the nation alongside Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. But the Government has refuted the Climate Action Tracker assessment, saying the analysis lacks nuance as it does not account for constraints faced by the country in its decarbonisation journey, such as its high population density and limited access to various renewable energy sources. The Climate Action Tracker is a collaboration between two Germany-based research organisations - Climate Analytics and the New Climate Institute. It analyses the climate pledges of 39 countries and the European Union, covering the biggest emitters as well as a representative sample of smaller emitters, which together contribute about 80 per cent of global emissions. The Republic contributes about 0.11 per cent to global emissions. WHAT THE REPORT SAID ABOUT SINGAPORE Last Wednesday (Sept 15), Climate Action Tracker published its analysis for Singapore's climate targets, ranking them as being \\\"critically insufficient\\\". This is the worst rating on its five-point scale. The other four are: highly insufficient, insufficient, almost sufficient and 1.5 deg C Paris Agreement compatible. Only one country - The Gambia - has targets deemed suitable for the highest category. Nations whose targets were labelled \\\"almost sufficient\\\" include Britain, Nepal, Costa Rica and Ethiopia. Jurisdictions with \\\"insufficient\\\" pledges include the European Union, the United States, Germany and Japan, while countries with \\\"highly insufficient\\\" pledges include Indonesia, China, Australia and India. Under the Paris Agreement, nations must take progressive action to reduce their carbon footprint so the world has a greater chance of limiting warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels - the threshold that warming must be kept to to avoid harsher climate impacts. On this front, Singapore in its updated climate pledge last year said the country's emissions will peak at 65 million tonnes by 2030. This means that even if the economy continues to grow, the amount of emissions produced should not. Over a longer time horizon, Singapore wants to halve the amount of emissions it produces from its 2030 peak by 2050, with the aim of achieving net-zero emissions \\\"as soon as viable in the second half of the century\\\".

This may result in a form of media bias - with different media outlets possessing varying levels of independence. For instance, *The Straits Times* in Singapore is widely regarded as a government-aligned publication due to its ownership by Singapore Press Holdings - which has close ties to the Singaporean government. In this context, it would be important to take into consideration a potential scenario whereby the publication becomes a platform for the manipulation of public discourse by the state - as opposed to a nuanced presentation of nuclear energy developments. This would have a significant impact on the results of the topic modeling and may lead to a skewed presentation of the narratives.\n",
