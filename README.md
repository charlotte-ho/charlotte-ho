## Greetings, Charlotte here ðŸŒ¾

ðŸª´ Here is my final research project for INAFU6502: Intro to Text Analysis in Python 

This study delves into the media portrayal of nuclear energy adoption in Southeast Asia, a region facing rapid industrialization and a projected 60% increase in energy demand by 2040. With growing energy-intensive tech investments and an urgent need for sustainable solutions, nuclear energy has become a key focus. The project investigates how media outlets in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore frame nuclear energy, exploring whether it is seen as a risky necessity or a forward-looking solution. Through data science techniques, this study uncovers the narratives shaping public opinion and policy decisions, offering insights into the barriers and opportunities for nuclear energy in the region. By understanding the media's role in shaping perceptions, the research aims to highlight how countries can build public trust in their nuclear energy programs as they move toward energy transition goals.
